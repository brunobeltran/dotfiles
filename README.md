# Bruno Beltran's Dotfiles.

Feel free to use the `install.sh` script to install them, but you should probably
change the relevant entries in `dotfiles/gitconfig` at least.

When installing, if your current dotfiles conflict with any of the files that
are being installed, they will be left unchanged and copied into this
repository, so that you can use `git diff` see what the difference is.
